# dls_dependency_tree

Tool for parsing support modules and their dependencies for version compatibility

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dls-dependency-tree>
:---:           | :---:
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/dls-dependency-tree:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/dls-dependency-tree/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from dls_dependency_tree import __version__

print(f"Hello dls_dependency_tree {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m dls_dependency_tree --version
```
